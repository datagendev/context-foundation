# Neon (Postgres)

Use this folder for notes, schemas, and integration details when **Neon** is your Postgres backend (warehouse, preview environments, sync target, etc.).

## What to keep here

- Connection + environment notes (where credentials live, who owns them)
- Schema conventions (naming, migrations, environments)
- Data model notes for GTM objects (accounts, contacts, opportunities, activities)
- Any DataGen workflow notes that depend on Neon-specific constraints (branching, autosuspend, etc.)

## Suggested files (create as needed)

- `setup.md`
- `schema.md`
- `data-model.md`
- `integration-notes.md`
