  - directory_type_check (high)
    - Reasoning: F6S is described as an online directory/listing platform for startups and companies; its homepage and site metadata identify it as a network and directory, thus it matches the required directory type.
  - employees_1000_plus_check (low)
    - Reasoning: The entity description mentions filters for company size that include firms with over 1,000 employees, and the Crunchbase hub lists companies with >1,000 employees, indicating such companies are represented in the directory.
  - strong_digital_presence_check (low)
    - Reasoning: Fetching the F6S homepage returned a bot‑block page and no traffic, keyword ranking, or social media metrics were obtainable; therefore a strong digital presence could not be confirmed.

    - Reasoning: The entity description explicitly states that BuiltWith provides a searchable directory focused on technology stacks and allows filtering by industry and company size, targeting users who need to discover B2B SaaS companies.

    - Reasoning: The cited BuiltWith trend pages explicitly reference downloadable lists of websites with 1,000 or more employees, indicating that the directory includes companies meeting the 1,000‑employee threshold.

    - Source: Datanyze - Market Share, Competitor Insights in Analytics - 6Sense — https://6sense.com/tech/analytics/datanyze-market-share
  - strong_digital_presence_check (medium)
    - Reasoning: The Concurate SEO analysis provides an estimate of about 34,000 monthly organic sessions, indicating moderate traffic. No concrete keyword ranking positions or official social‑media follower counts were found, resulting in 'NR' for rankings and 'NA' for social metrics. Because the directory lacks strong, verifiable ranking and social presence, it does not fully meet the strong digital presence criterion.
