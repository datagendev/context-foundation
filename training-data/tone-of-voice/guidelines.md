# Tone of Voice Guidelines

How we communicate - the personality behind our content.

## Core Principles

### 1. Talk Like Humans
- Conversational, not corporate
- Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Write how you'd explain to a smart friend

### 2. Treat Readers as Individuals
- "You" not "users" or "customers"
- Acknowledge their intelligence
- Don't over-explain obvious things
- Respect their time

### 3. No Buzzwords
Avoid:
- "Leverage"
- "Synergy"
- "Best-in-class"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Seamless"
- "Robust"

Use instead:
- Simple, specific language
- Concrete examples
- Actual outcomes

### 4. Don't Waste Time
- Get to the point
- Lead with value
- Cut filler words
- Every sentence earns its place

## Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Yes | No |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Confident** | "Here's how it works" | "We think maybe this could help" |
| **Direct** | "This saves 4 hours/week" | "This may potentially reduce time" |
| **Helpful** | "Try this approach" | "Consider exploring options" |
| **Human** | "We've been there" | "Our team understands challenges" |

## Writing Style

### Sentences
- Short and punchy
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice
- Strong verbs

### Paragraphs
- 2-4 sentences max
- White space is your friend
- Break up walls of text

### Structure
- Lead with the takeaway
- Use headers liberally
- Bulleted lists for scanning
- Bold key points

## Examples

### Before (Corporate)
> "Our revolutionary platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to seamlessly integrate with your existing workflows, enabling best-in-class results for your organization."

### After (Human)
> "Connect to your existing tools in 5 minutes. The AI handles the busywork so you can focus on closing deals."

## Testing Your Copy

Ask:
1. Would I say this out loud?
2. Does every word earn its place?
3. Is the value clear in the first sentence?
4. Would this make me click/read/respond?
