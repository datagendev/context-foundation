# Copywriting Fundamentals

Timeless principles for persuasive writing.

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Clarity Above All
- If it can be misunderstood, it will be
- Simple words > complex words
- Short sentences > long sentences
- One idea per paragraph

### 2. Benefits Over Features
- **Feature**: "AI-powered automation"
- **Benefit**: "Save 10 hours per week"
- Always answer: "So what? Why should I care?"

### 3. Specificity Sells
- **Weak**: "Improve your results"
- **Strong**: "Close 23% more deals in Q1"
- Numbers, names, and details build trust

### 4. The Reader is the Hero
- They don't care about you
- They care about their problems
- Position yourself as the guide, not the hero

## Structure Principles

### AIDA Framework
1. **Attention**: Hook them immediately
2. **Interest**: Make it relevant to them
3. **Desire**: Show the transformation
4. **Action**: Tell them exactly what to do

### PAS Framework
1. **Problem**: Agitate the pain
2. **Agitation**: Make it worse
3. **Solution**: Present the relief

### The Inverted Pyramid
- Most important info first
- Supporting details second
- Background last
- (Readers drop off - front-load value)

## Headlines

### What Makes Headlines Work
- Specificity (numbers, names)
- Curiosity gap
- Self-interest
- News/novelty
- How-to promise

### Headline Formulas
- "How to [Get Desired Outcome] Without [Pain Point]"
- "[Number] Ways to [Achieve Goal]"
- "The [Adjective] Guide to [Topic]"
- "Why [Counterintuitive Statement]"
- "[Do This], Not [That]"

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] Cut every unnecessary word
- [ ] Replace weak verbs with strong ones
- [ ] Remove adverbs (very, really, extremely)
- [ ] Eliminate passive voice
- [ ] Check: Would I say this out loud?
- [ ] Read it aloud - does it flow?
- [ ] Is the CTA crystal clear?

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Burying the lead | Put the main point first |
| Talking about yourself | Focus on the reader |
| Vague claims | Add specific proof |
| Wall of text | Break into short paragraphs |
| Weak CTA | Tell them exactly what to do |
| Passive voice | Make the subject do the action |

## The Editing Process

1. **Write ugly** - Get ideas out, don't edit
2. **Cut 30%** - Your first draft is too long
3. **Read aloud** - Catch awkward phrasing
4. **Sleep on it** - Fresh eyes find problems
5. **Get feedback** - Others see what you miss
