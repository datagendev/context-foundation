# Training Data

Examples and principles that teach the AI system how to produce better outputs.

## Purpose

This folder contains the "taste" and "expertise" that makes outputs high-quality:
- Before/after editing examples
- Brand voice guidelines
- Copywriting principles
- Style corrections

## Folders

### tone-of-voice/
Brand and founder voice guidelines:
- How we sound
- Words we use / don't use
- Personality traits
- Example content that nails the voice

### editing-examples/
Before/after pairs showing how to improve AI output:
- "AI wrote this" → "I edited it to this"
- Why the change was made
- Pattern to apply going forward

### copywriting-principles/
Universal writing principles:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Human-sounding language
- No buzzwords
- Respect reader's time

## How Training Data Works

```
AI Output → Human Edit → Training Example → Better Future Output
```

Each week:
1. Review AI outputs
2. Make edits
3. Add before/after to training data
4. Document the principle behind the change
5. AI learns from accumulated examples

## Training Example Template

```markdown
# Training Example: [Category]

## Before (AI Output)
[Original AI-generated text]

## After (Human Edit)
[Edited version]

## Why Changed
[Explanation of what was wrong and why the edit is better]

## Principle
[Universal rule to apply going forward]

## Tags
- tone
- clarity
- specificity
- [etc.]
```

## Compounding Effect

From the Pixie case study:
> "Every week I add a few more examples. Every week the output has gotten much much better progressively."

The key is consistency:
- Add 3-5 examples per week
- Focus on patterns, not one-offs
- Extract universal principles
- Update agents to use new principles
