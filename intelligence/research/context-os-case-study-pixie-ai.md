I'm super happy to present my first context operating system case study. This is my conversation with Victor Sawyers. He's the head of go to market at Pixie AI. He's a seasoned goto market operator. Yeah, I think that's the saying, right? Operator. Um, who I really respect. He's got a ton of expertise and I really love working with him. This is a deep dive into the overlap between go to market and context engineering. At its core, my context OS approach takes the constant context switching and always having to reexplain yourself to AI and turns that into a compounding intelligent asset. I think that gets smarter the more I use it. It's AI that always has the context. It's the way kind of think of it. So, Victor and I are going to talk about the go to market operating system we built out. He's going to talk a little bit about the methodologies I developed and that kind of set the foundation and how he's taken the system and gone and run with it, which has been awesome to see. Uh he's going to talk a little bit about the problems that kind of led him to want to bring in my context engineering approach and expertise. You're going to learn what a context operating system is, how it works, uh where it creates value for go to market, and you're also going to learn where it creates uh the be most amount of value and the least amount of value, okay? Where it's not the tool for the job. It's been an absolute pleasure to work with him and the rest of the team at Pixie. They are definitely pushing the edge, not just in their go to market, but in their core product as well. Um, so if you are in application security and interested in automated remediation, you should definitely find some time to chat with them. Let's get into it. >> Okay, Victor, thanks so much for being here today. Uh, I really appreciate the time. We're going to be talking about the context operating system. You and I have been working for Pixie. Um, do you mind telling us a little bit about your background, how we kind of got to working together, and we can kind of dive into the system after that? >> Yeah, sure. Well, thanks for having me. Um so I am sort of a serial operator. I've been uh part of startups in the sort of transition from founderled sales into scale uh for the past 15 years. I've had kind of all the hats, right? Like head of sales, head of CS, threetime VP of revops. um and always love the like early stage mess of how do we codify go to market motion how do we build from sort of the early signals of what's working and sort of build an infrastructure to scale that so you and I started working when I joined Pixie which is a seedstage uh cyber security company um that uses AI to effectively automate product security engineering work to find and fix the vulnerabilities and code bases that should be fixed. Um, and when I joined Pixie, which is I guess five, six months ago maybe at this point, um, Pixie had transitioned from a PLG sort of engineer developer centric product in motion into a proper B2B enterprise sales motion. um and was really building kind of the go to market um not from scratch like we have a head of sales um and the founder one of the founders who's been selling but that's it the rest of the company's like 18 engineers um >> and so when I came in it was really to own like foundational growth like how do we build pipeline how do we advance deals faster and support our head of sales and so on and so forth yeah >> yeah exactly >> um and I guess prior started joining Pixie, I'd also spent um you know a year at Primary Ventures looking at AI and go to market all the vendors, all the spaces seeing if we could build conviction to build a company. Um y >> and so when I joined like I and the founders knew like we were going to push marketing as fast as possible in as a form as possible um and run a really lean team. So that's been like, you know, a secondary mandate uh alongside like just grow the hell out of this thing. >> It makes sense. Yeah. So I guess when we first started talking, >> what was something that stood out to you about the approach? I can talk a little about like how I think of the context operating systems, but I'd love to think hear about it in like your own works basically when we first scoping things out. >> Yeah. Um, you know, I think like if if anyone follows you, there's there's a ton of focus on building something that can compound. Um, that takes kind of core operating principles and knowledge and builds a context system that is constantly learning from what's there and that can take advantage of kind of new shifts in the models and underlying capabilities alongside kind of what we learn as a goto market organization. >> Yeah. And um you know when I came into Pixie specifically with a team of one like we had all of these different components of work across the customer life cycle. So it's like foundational stand up like our our marketing messaging and content production work streams. Build the signal based sort of triggers and harness for an outbound motion. Do the like rev ops work to manage the middle of funnel and help kind of surface leads and do the scoring etc. etc., etc. So, >> um, you know, I think that lends itself really well to a system that can get smarter over time, can compound, that can build agents into. Um, and what I didn't know and you taught me was just like how flexible it can become because you have like this modular like building blocks. >> Yeah. I mean, it's been we'll get into showing more of the system, but I really enjoyed building the like developing the like kind of growing the knowledge base first and then handing it off to you and then you seeing it take it to like the moon and beyond has been awesome to see because one of the things I really think about is like you want it to conform as tightly as possible to your actual workflows and problems and seeing that actually work really well for you. Like I feel like you spend more time in the thing than I do now. Like >> I mean I hope so because like I don't sleep because it's funny. Yeah. Um, so I guess we can start with the content because I feel that's pretty tangible. Um, just for context, one of the things that we worked on was I built out a workload that ingests 150 to 200, you know, articles that you've curated, right, from application security industry experts, influencers, newsletters, everything. and that gets um classified for relevance to Pixie's kind of like understanding of the market and perspective. Um I think maybe you can speak to this is like being having be independently valuable and then amplify like you curating it. Um well yeah could you speak a little bit to like I realized your perspective when you brought this as like something to work on. Um could you speak to a little about that? >> Yeah and I guess like and do you want me to show it at the same time? Let's talk about it first and then we can pull it up on cool the actual workflow system. >> The like the way I think about the context is it's sort of right like a a dump of everything we know and that's there's different buckets of that. So first and most importantly is the like institutional knowledge that's inside the walls of your company. >> Right? So I was joining an organization of repeat founders and an experienced engineering team that's like lived this problem space for their entire careers >> and um had some content had call transcripts like had real conviction on the space um and as any organization like Google Drive or whatever folders of information >> um and and a CRM that was in pretty good shape. Um credit to our head of sales I think he had built like a pretty good system um And so like that's bucket one is like what do we know and what do we know from our customers and our prospects and can we extract that? Um and that's like the foundational stuff. >> And then there's sort of like your third party sets of information and that can be varied like are you buying data? Um are you scraping information that's publicly available? And um what we started out to build I think is like a real synthesis of those different data streams. Um >> and so and there's different hierarchies, right? Like the stuff we know we know is scored and weighted higher than like deep research uh prompts that we're extracting and bringing information in. Um, >> yeah, >> but the two are really valuable, especially in the early stage cuz like there's there's just we don't have 20 years of kind of first party data crammed into Salesforce, right? Like that's not the situation. >> Yeah. And effectively synthesizing those while also maintaining an audit chain of what you can know and can't know, right? Because I think everyone knows, you know, you'll get the AI conflict hallucinating. You're absolutely right. Um, one of the things I think is so effective with a system like this is it's plain English, but you can still audit all the way through. It's like, well, I went to this link and this link and this maybe it's a good time to actually start >> showing some system. Yeah. >> Um, yeah. Let me like walk through like very tangibly like how it's laid out and why I think um, you know, what you've you've built here is reallyive. So, >> um, cloud code, right? like a lot of folks aren't in it is essentially a folder system um with markdown files, text files and and it's it is literally files on the desktop or in GitHub. >> And the way we've organized it is um the folders follow a hierarchical structure. Um >> and I think the like easiest way to make that real is to like maybe look at the customer folder, right? So like >> yeah, it's a great idea. Um what we have at the core of the customer folder are all our calls, right? Um >> and like just pick random demo call. Um >> so all of these transcripts are in here across kind of our entire team >> and it's the raw sort of voice of customer um at its core. And then on top of the calls u we now are appending a synthesis. So like what happened in the call, what's the tool stack that we extracted that's relevant to Pixie, um other information, you know, we have medpek that's uh being extracted out of these calls. >> Um that's getting pushed to CRM. So we're trying to like automate some of the tedious workflows of a rep. >> Um but more importantly, like those call transcripts in the customer folder are then all rolled up collectively. at this point there's several hundred calls um into like what we call these synthesis documents. Um so you know you got all the pain points across all the calls, all the objections um you know the running kind of log of um each call like vertical specific analysis. Um, and those are foundational documents that um, we look at manually as well as getting updated by like AI off the call transcripts and then they form like each folder has these like synthesis canonical docs of data and information >> and they get rolled up to um, effectively like the found core foundational documents of the company. Um, you know, like >> our our sort of >> what is Pixie? What do we do? Who are we? How are we different? Um, what's happening in our industry that the AI should care about when it's thinking about being pixie, right? >> Yeah. And how do you get it to sound use the right language consistently over and over again, right? Instead of just feed in stuff to your chatbt window over and over. >> Yeah. >> All the copy and pasting. Yeah. Uh and then the folders right are like they're primarily agentic but they are trying to be usable for humans as well like we we are in here. >> Um but the so that's the folder hierarchy and then the thing you built which I think is has been like >> really genius is effectively like a knowledge graph system on top to do semantic linking >> between documents across folders etc. And that's that's also really powerful. Um >> raffle here. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. So it's a bad extension to show it, but uh I think it'll get the point across which is like >> see the message. >> Okay. So that like however many files are in this system, right? They're all linked together. >> Um so I'm pretty sure you know this is like product over here or something like that. Yeah, there's a technical product overview. like I'm sure this is like foundational customer information or synthesis like call stuff >> and um what happens is that we um have instructed the agent in the like command files of claude like how to use the linking between documents. >> Exactly. So it grounds it. Yeah. >> Yeah. So like this is the linking >> y >> um which you built >> and then the every time you prompt the system it's loading you know the instructions effectively and the instructions are like okay well what is this like first of all it's cloud code but this is not for code it's for pixie and go to market >> um this is who we are whatever this is like how to use uh the files this is where stuff is >> and so if you're prompting it about customer intelligence or content content creation like the agent is going to very quickly go to the right documents in the right folder. It's very token efficient, but it's also bringing the connective tissue of all the stuff together >> and so the outputs like tend to be better, right? Um, so I think that's been the the genius of the system. >> Yeah. I just just uh kind of the way I think about it like you want to remove as many layers of stuff in between the raw context, the AI and the human being driving the system >> because that just like allows everything to flow so much better. And like I know this graph looks insane to people, but like you're not using this to like navigate around the graph. This is just showing how everything is grounded to one another. >> Yeah. >> Or grounded to so when you have a agent grounded into the graph, it's always using, you know, your positioning your doc, you know, that you've like is your living source of truth. So that's other things like this whole system is get versions. So when we decide, all right, we want to make a huge change to this section because it doesn't matter anymore. You know, maybe we want to roll back, maybe we want to use it move forward. The whole point is it's like a living document that you can continuously update. And then if you want to bring something back, you just go into the git logs and pull it back. >> Yeah, for sure. Which you've had to do when I break it. So, >> well, that's um I mean that's one of the the features, right? It's like let's just go ship it and see what happens and then see how it changes uh the pay for the agent and like everything is totally empirical based. >> Yeah, for sure. So I guess from here I guess we could show maybe the like weekly content production workflow kind of bringing in the apps like weekly briefing and then I'd be curious to understand like I know we can't show the full kind of u workflow takes too long and um but maybe just like the briefing document and the output that you drive because that's all you you know the system I built I the way I see it is like the system I built is like amplify your taste and expertise in this space and you can go marketing growth. So, >> sure. Um, yeah. So, I would say content creation in general is like one of the core working um strengths of the system and one of the focus areas that like we >> um that we focus on early on. So, there's a few ways this happens, right? So, like going back to like intelligence and like what are we working from? Um, you know, the system is hooked in via API to a bunch of like uh SEO research libraries and like we've got um in the content strategy doc like the topic areas, the clusters, the keywords like group by persona and product lines, stuff like that. So there's foundational context um for the content creation in general and then there's a few ways the system runs. So you mentioned apps like weekly. I'll touch on that. I'll show it in detail in a second. >> Um but there's also just like the the idea that this is this can be agentic um and and flow with or without humans in the loop. And so like one of them is is more just like a general um content production system. Yeah. >> And um so this is a set of like seven I guess it's eight now agents that um work with you at various steps to um effectively like design the content that we're going to create. So maybe I have you know just a generic idea of a topic or maybe I say hey go look at the SEO topic clusters pick one we haven't talked about recently and give me something I should be writing about. Um, >> and it will go do that and suggest some angles. You say yes or no or modify it and then it flows through and it's like okay well now we have the angle like what's the premise like what's our hook? What's the headline? Um, okay. And now let's go build uh the outline uh of the content and the way we've built the system this is asking for human input throughout the system. Um, and I think >> yeah it's pretty powerful. I mean, you believe in augmentation. You've also designed it so that um I think it works like within the constraints of an LLM, right? Like it's it's storing things at micro checkpoints so it's not going off the rails. >> Yeah. >> Um and then we're validating um SEO. We're like, you know, removing m dashes and other AI tells. Yeah. And also the >> the copyrightiting rule set you created. That was a good addition to the system. Yeah. >> Yeah. I'll get into that in the appsec one. Um, and then we have founder tone of voice like brand tone of voice guideline and documents. We've got, you know, copyrightiting principles from like the madman era that it knows about. Um, >> yeah. >> And and that all all can help. Um, so the appsacly briefing is basically our automated um still use automated with like quotes maybe right now, but uh it's our newsletter. So it's a weekly newsletter and effectively what is happening is that we have built >> a um >> giant RSS feed of anything and everything we can think of that might touch application security and cyber security more broadly and um every day the system and this isn't in cloud code this is pipe dream it could be nadn or equivalent you could probably do it in cloud code um >> deploy your own. Yeah. Yeah. Piper's a good Piper is a good balance. That's why I like it because you can write real code and put it up and it'll it'll run. But >> um it's working well. So, thank you. Right. So, it's it's fetching the articles every day, hundreds of them. >> Um and then there's a series of prompts that's sort of categorizing those articles for um uh the topics or whatever that are. Oh, this is the wrong one. This is the second part of the >> That's the generator one. Yeah. >> Um >> this is the one that runs every day. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, it's it's grabbing um the articles. It's classifying them into like pillars maybe that we care about um and like why they might be relevant for us. Is it talking about stuff our customers and prospects would care about? So, it's grabbing all those articles, it's classifying them, and it's storing them all in a database. So I don't know the exact number. Maybe you know off the top of your head how many >> 1300400 now. >> Yeah. >> You know it does like 150 a week which is like impossible for human to read all those at once. So >> yeah exactly. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um, so then it's it's taking the 150 in a week that are relevant and storing them and then it's generating effectively like an internal research brief on um those 150 articles and um maybe I won't show you like the internal side of that but like it's you can think of it basically as like a Google doc top three things that happened this week what it what it means for Pixie. Y >> it's it's suggesting like specific content angles that we could write about in terms of current events. Um and you could imagine the pixie. Yeah. That relates to apps like in general. Yeah. >> Yeah. And you can imagine like saying, "Yep, that's interesting." And then it flows into that content production plug-in um and set of agents that we just went through. >> Yeah. >> Um so that that's the um the second pipeline, right? So, it's a series of of prompts that build and effectively create that internal briefing. That internal briefing then gets dumped back inside Claude and um we then have uh a whole set of um additional commands and agents that create a public facing version of um that internal brief. And yeah, um, so it's it's probably five prompts, I think, that do that. It's a templatized sort of output. >> Um, it's up on our website if you want to go check it out. Um, >> do a good job with it. Yeah. >> Yeah. It runs every week. And then it also will take that and and generate like the HTML email. It'll push that into HubSpot and then like we're basically auditing and pressing send. Um, >> yeah, exactly. >> So that's the process. And then like you mentioned training it to be better I guess over time and like this idea of comp the compound effect. Um so what ended up happening is like I would get the initial like runs of this stuff and be like well yeah okay but like I'm still going to spend a few hours editing it. >> Editing it up. Yeah. >> And so that's what I would do. And um rather than like oneoff edit um the thing like we started to build principles of our content and in this case like specifically editorial like this is not a product that sells pixie. This is a genuine like be useful newsletter to our market. Um >> yeah exactly >> and like we had to yeah we had to train it to do that. >> Yeah. >> Um so there's examples in like the data. that's like, "Hey, this is what I said before. This is what I wrote. Um, and here's why I changed it." And there's probably 30 or 40 examples in this training doc now. Every week I add a few more. >> Um, and then there's like universal principles that it's um pulled out, right, for um how we want to write and what we want to do. It's like we want to talk like humans. We want to treat you like an individual. we don't want to use buzzwords like we don't want to waste your time like and >> so now those agents that are running and creating the next weeks like have these principles they have examples every week the output I think we're on week six or seven of doing this the output has gotten much much better progressively >> um and I'm curious now with like uh anthropic releasing like a bunch of stuff >> 4.5 like >> how much better is it gonna be without us doing any more work. Um, >> yeah. >> So, yeah, that's like one of them >> on the content side. The last thing I'll mention there is um there's also agents in here. I mean, skills in here now. Um, >> skills are huge. Yeah. >> Like, yeah. >> What is listening? Skills are just so the technical term is like progressive context exposure. All the media of dumping all the context into the AI at once. you give a little, you know, shorter version that says, "Hey, when you're working on copywriting, go call this skill and then when you need more information about how to write copy for the newsletter, then go read this file." And what happens is because the agent is not like getting just like overwhelmed with all this information at once. It can break down tasks into smaller pieces. And when it breaks down a task to smaller piece, it does it better. So over time, right, the much smaller you make a task, the more attention it can focus on it. in the more specific context, you can say, "All right, when you're on this step, use this skill to always make sure you sound this way, right?" Um, so that's one of the things when skills weren't out when we first started this. So, we had like we adapted it we adapted basically the methods we're already using already and just put them into skills. >> Um, >> yeah. Like the two things I like about it. So, one is the way they're designed. Like you don't have to say use this skill, right? I'm just I just say like, "Hey, I'm editing this thing and it knows So that's great. It's great for me, but like I built the system. I could tell it like to go do explicit stuff. I kind of like know where all the skeletons are. But now I've got six people on my team using it and they don't, you know, they're not looking in here. Um, and so like like Ebony on our team, she's doing her social media. >> Um, all she has to do is like, "Hey, I'm editing this post." And it will know uh what to do and what to call and how to like try to help her as efficiently as possible. >> Yeah. I mean that's a good segue. I guess getting into well the way that's enabled is through get versioning but I guess we'd also then talk a little bit about what I guess the word I want to use basically version but I'm trying to find like what is the value of seeing more people onboard onto it and you being able to basically like still manage everyone's you know interactions with the tooling and kind of like taking all of the work off of them but benefit still. Yeah. >> Well there's like there's a few things and it depends on the use cases. Like one of the things that's so cool about this is again how flexible it is. Um so so maybe I'll like pick out two. So one is um Sarra, our CEO um is is using this like part of it is content creation. A lot of the stuff you just saw except his version of that. Yeah. >> Um but he was also he's you know he's thinking about our series A >> race arrays and our sort of positioning narrative and story with VCs >> and and also within that like what's the product vision long term. Um >> and so like one of the things he did was point this brain if you will at our code repositories >> and he's like what do we have? Why is it different? Like what makes it so cool? Um and then what's in the road map um based on you know like our version of Jira >> and we have weekly engineering meetings where they're talking about kind of all that stuff. So those transcripts are in the product folder >> um and so like he's designed this like forwardlooking sort of scope um that's part product roadmap and vision or category positioning and it's now in here and it's like the more aspirational vision stuff. Um and that's been really cool to see. >> Yeah. >> Um so that's like one use case. The other one is like our sales team. >> Um so we had a new um SCR start uh this week >> and first of all I just told it to like create an onboarding guide and like this is >> knew where everything was. Yeah. >> Yeah. It's good. Right. And then okay I read it and I was like oh it's missing this missing that like add this. Um, and it but it has voice of customer. It has the objection like it's it's just dynamite. Um, >> yeah. >> Uh, and so that's like an obvious use case, but then there's also like the ramp time and like cutting that down. So, not just onboarding docs, but hey, um, you don't know our domain, but like we need you to do exhaustive real high quality research on every prospect because like >> on this domain. Yeah. >> Yeah. Like we we're not spraying prey. Like we have a very targeted ICP. It's not infinite. There's probably >> 200,000 people in the world we really want to talk to. Um, >> and so now like it just says research prospect, right? And like it spins up the agents, it does the work, it pushes that intel into our CRM. Um, >> or if he wants to draft a sales email, right? It's the same thing >> on there on Mark >> down. And it and it's not just in Markdown, right? Like the thing that you built also connects to the CRM and other tools. So it's able to go say like okay what do we already have this contact? Have we talked to other people at the company? Like let's figure it out. >> Yeah. So it's limiting all these data and context silos. You just move across all >> normal context switching. Yeah. >> That's the goal. Yeah. >> Yeah. That's a big one I think I think people underestimate just because you know we're so used to have to go into Gmail and I have to go into the CRM to go into like all these different tools. We take it for granted that it doesn't have to be that way. And when it's not that way, you're like, "Oh, wait. This is so much better than anything else." >> Um, so >> yeah, I mean that that's really cool. I guess one of the things I'm curious now about, so we we've talked a little about what the system has has done really well. One of the things, you know, I always want to like level. So one of the things I want want to talk about is one of one of the things like maybe is there a high learning curve? like what who would benefit from this and who would be like maybe find something else to use. Um >> sure. Um you know I think I wrote about like I don't think RevOps is dead uh recently because >> yeah a good chunk of work has gone into crafting the system, architecting the intel. There's a we didn't talk about it but like there's a bunch of automations that are running here to keep the content fresh up to date. Yeah. >> Yeah. And like there was a bunch of upfront design work to do that. Um, >> yep. >> And to maintain it, >> building that workflow. Yeah. >> Yeah. So, I think like that's not to be underestimated. And that trade-off is all like it always exists between like if you're going to do custom versus offtheshelf, right? Like um you know there's certain capabilities we haven't talked about today like monitoring the LinkedIn ecosystem. um that like you could probably use Clay and Trigify and plug into Hey Reach and sort of build a version of what we have too, but it wouldn't be quite as tweaked and tailored. Um or there's like Momentum or other tools that'll take the call transcripts and update the CRM and build next steps and suggest copy, right? And I think at scale when you're operating with multiple product lines and tons of teams and you need it all in a data warehouse and like it's a real trade-off to build bespoke. Um so >> at least like the system we have right now I think is geared towards smaller earlier stage teams that want to >> really execute um custom workflows. So that's like one and I I think about the founder archetype of like I'm gonna I'm the system you've built here >> is >> it it does go to market things right but like it's really about as you said augmenting the people and letting them build their workflows and supercharge like whatever they want to do. >> Um and that's like a different approach and mindset to like the software stack a little bit >> and it lends itself well to early Yeah. And then the second part is like content creators and like marketing teams. I think this is like a this is a home run to have something like this >> because you Yeah. I think the the thing that I found that even as I work on these things is so surprising to me is like how much of this is the value is in the power and simplicity and like it'll connect to your other tools, right? But getting comfortable in seeing all right well like when there's nothing in the way between the simplest possible version storing this information that's the value and to your point it's also like the trade-off >> because you know then you have to like onboard new users like all right this is how you interact with the system um you know the cloud just released cloud code in the desktop version which is how you'd interact with maybe like a prettier UI over time right you'll all find and people will find the right balance and trade-off between the power of like the raw system making it more user friendly. >> Yeah. >> Um >> Yeah. I could tell you I wouldn't want to onboard 20 sales reps into cloud code like >> have to get them to work it. Yeah. >> Yeah. But like the one SDR that's sitting next to me every day. Yep. It's great. >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So that's uh it's pretty much everything to cover so far. I guess maybe one last thing is the uh you I know you've gone really crazy and like used the system as inspiration for your own version and other stuff like that. What was the thing that is like why did you do that? I guess I was like really curious. >> Yeah. Well, I mean I geek out on this stuff. So that's part of it. Yeah. >> Um like there's there's the core principles of like hey the models are getting better like you've got to augment yourself and I I believe that fundamentally >> and the like archetypes of load context about yourself and how you like to work and what you know in and so the system and AI outputs are just like better and better over time. Like that's number one. >> Yeah. >> Um number two like personally I'm working on a lot of different projects. Some are go to market so like the tie-in is pretty explicit or like content focused but but not all of them >> and I think like the system >> has turned me into like a coder. Don't tell the 18 engineers I work with like >> um but I am pretty sure that like I use more of the like cloud API credits than they do in a given week. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Pushing more through it. Yeah, for sure. >> Yeah. Um, and that's cuz like the Pixie product is super complex and like they're doing a lot manually. But >> yeah. >> Um, >> but there's this like archetype data pattern that I think AI unlocks which is like, hey, I want to go map a space. I want to extract as much information and context and data about that space. >> I want to um inspect it, ask questions about it, build a mental map around it, and then like form an opinion about it. And then once I have an opinion, I want to distill it down into something and create. Um, and like that pattern, which is like the hierarchal folder pattern of the system. >> Yeah. >> It's just been really cool to like build small and fairly large things that like kind of do that. So like >> Yeah. And work up and down that chain. Yeah. >> Yeah. Um, so like just for fun, I built a survival repository. They're like, >> "Okay, if if the zombies gone, like what should I do?" Like >> I don't know. Just for fun. That's fun. No, it's cool. I'll link that one because it is is a useful resource. I think the big one with that the core I think about is the AI has made plain English code, right? It's made plain English. You can all the logic you ever need, you can basically communicate in plain plain English. And now the barrier to entry, the thing I always say is like the barrier is not better models, better tools. It is the clarity of the your understanding of the problem, what you want to solve, how you want to solve it, why you want to solve it. So that clarity of thinking like AI just compounds whatever you give it. So you like if you have a really high quality understanding of the problem it has compounded all the way through to the end. If you don't know right then that's where you get hallucinations. It's where you get junk you get generic outputs. Um I think the system at its core is just solves that problem like exceptionally well like down to the the basics. >> Yeah that's really interesting. Um, and I guess like maybe the last thing that you taught me, which I had no idea how powerful would it would be, is that like >> I don't know, cloud code is working locally. Um, and so you're getting rid of a lot of like context limitations, right? You can see all the files on your computer, can work on those, and then it's really easy to have like six or seven prompt windows open and like multitask like run. So you can just move so fast when it's working, right, and not crashing at least. >> Yeah, exactly. Well, that's the thing I think about like it accelerates your iteration tempo, right? Compounds the same, you know, once you solve a problem, you never have to solve it twice. Uh and that asynchronous collaboration because once it's up, right, everyone has access to what you know, the brand new positioning, they just pull it down, works immediately. Um when it doesn't crash and things like that, but >> which isn't like that's not the fault of what Jacob, that's an anthropic problem with cursor, whatever. I think it's just I think uh you can only have maybe six or seven is too high. Maybe three or four clouds is is is enough for a lot of most people. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean >> to buy we need to buy more RAM, >> right? It's enough for everyone to be honest. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, I uh I really appreciate the time. This is a great conversation. >> Yeah. Thank you. >> I hope you enjoyed that conversation. Uh if you're in go to market and tired of the endless context switching, this is probably system for you. Uh, I'm working on making this and all my learnings, methodologies, approaches, and more tests accessible. So, if you want to stay in the loop, make sure to subscribe. Um, but regardless, I just hope you learned something useful. Uh, if you are in last thing, right? Uh, if you're in application security, go check out Pixie. They are awesome. Uh, and thank you so much for your time. I really hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. Bye.
