Scrunch is a **data-driven influencer marketing platform** that helps businesses connect with social media content creators for brand campaigns ([ainfluencer.com](https://ainfluencer.com/scrunch/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Danielle%20Lewis%20founded,into%20the%20platform%E2%80%99s%20features%2C%C2%A0%20pricing)). Launched in 2015 by Danielle Lewis, the platform provides tools to **search**, **connect**, **negotiate**, and **collaborate** with influencers across major channels (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) ([ainfluencer.com](https://ainfluencer.com/scrunch/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Danielle%20Lewis%20founded,into%20the%20platform%E2%80%99s%20features%2C%C2%A0%20pricing)) ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=As%20an%20influencer%20marketplace%2C%20Scrunch,is%3A%20how%20well%3F%20The%20answer)). In essence, Scrunch operates as an online marketplace where brands can find and manage influencer partnerships, leveraging a database of millions of influencer profiles to plan and track marketing campaigns. 

## Who Are Their Customers?  
Scrunch’s customers are primarily **brands and marketing agencies** – especially **small businesses** – looking to engage in influencer marketing ([ainfluencer.com](https://ainfluencer.com/scrunch/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Danielle%20Lewis%20founded,into%20the%20platform%E2%80%99s%20features%2C%C2%A0%20pricing)) ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=Best%20for%3A%20Small%20brands%20in,Australia%2FNew%20Zealand)). The platform is designed and priced with smaller companies in mind (using a freemium SaaS model), making it accessible for organizations with limited marketing budgets ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=Scrunch%20is%20a%20subscription,at%20each%20level%20of%20service)) ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=Best%20for%3A%20Small%20brands%20in,Australia%2FNew%20Zealand)). While Scrunch is **best suited for small brands (particularly in Australia/New Zealand) ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=Best%20for%3A%20Small%20brands%20in,Australia%2FNew%20Zealand))**, it has also attracted *high-profile clients* – for example, **Vogue** and **Mini** have used Scrunch, and the company even secured a partnership with NewsCorp to expand its reach ([influencermarketinghub.com](https://influencermarketinghub.com/scrunch/#:~:text=Without%20even%20going%20into%20The,growth%20opportunity%20for%20the%20future)). This indicates that although Scrunch targets smaller enterprises, larger brands have found value in its influencer marketing tools as well.
