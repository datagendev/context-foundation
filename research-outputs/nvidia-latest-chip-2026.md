# Nvidia Latest Chip Announcements 2026

## Executive Summary

Nvidia has announced several major chip developments for 2026-2027, focusing on AI inference workloads with the new Rubin platform. The key announcement is the Rubin CPX, a specialized GPU for massive-context AI processing.

## Key Announcements

### Rubin CPX - AI Inference Specialist

Nvidia unveiled the **Rubin CPX**, a new class of GPU purpose-built for massive-context processing. This represents a strategic shift acknowledging that general-purpose GPUs are giving way to specialized inference chips.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Compute Power**: Up to 30 petaflops with NVFP4 precision
- **Memory**: 128GB of cost-efficient GDDR7
- **Use Cases**: Million-token software coding, generative video processing
- **Availability**: End of 2026

**Performance Claims:**
Designed to handle demanding context-based workloads with groundbreaking speed and efficiency for AI systems processing massive contexts.

### Rubin Platform Roadmap

**Rubin NVL144 (2026):**
- 3.6 EFLOPS of dense FP4 compute
- 1.2 ExaFLOPS of FP8 training
- Significant upgrade over B300 NVL72 (1.1 EFLOPS / 0.36 ExaFLOPS)

**Rubin Ultra (H2 2027):**
- Next-generation platform following Rubin
- Further performance improvements expected

### Consumer GPU Market

**RTX 3060 Revival:**
- Returning in Q1 2026 to address current-gen GPU and memory shortages
- No new RTX 50-series announcements expected at CES 2026 (entire series launched in 2025)

## Strategic Implications

### Market Shift
Nvidia's announcement signals the "end of the general-purpose GPU era" as the company splits its product lines:
- Training GPUs (general-purpose)
- Inference GPUs (specialized, like Rubin CPX)

This reflects the maturing AI infrastructure market where workloads are increasingly specialized.

### Competitive Landscape
At CES 2026, Nvidia faces competition from:
- Intel's next-gen chips
- AMD's GPU announcements
- Snapdragon's AI processors

The memory shortage issue ("Memory Pandemic Era") is driving product decisions across the industry.

## Timeline

- **Q1 2026**: RTX 3060 returns to market
- **End 2026**: Rubin CPX availability
- **2026**: Rubin platform launch
- **H2 2027**: Rubin Ultra launch
- **Post-2027**: Feynman platform (added to roadmap)
