## Key Insights

### Scrunch's Unique Differentiators

Based on competitive research, Scrunch's unique strengths include:

1. **Agent Experience Platform (AXP)**: Automatically serves AI-optimized versions of websites to LLM crawlers - competitors lack this technical capability

2. **Multi-Platform Monitoring**: Tracks brand presence across all major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Meta AI) - most competitors focus on traditional search

3. **AI-First Design**: Built specifically for AI search from the ground up, not a traditional SEO tool retrofitted with AI features

4. **Real-Time Insights**: Provides actionable recommendations on why brands aren't appearing in AI results and how to fix it

### Market Gaps & Opportunities

- **Enterprise Focus**: Many competitors target SMBs; Scrunch's enterprise positioning (Lenovo, Crunchbase) is differentiated
- **Technical Depth**: AXP is a unique technical capability that requires deep LLM knowledge
- **Comprehensive Platform**: Full loop of monitor → analyze → optimize vs point solutions
