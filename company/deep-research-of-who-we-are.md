## What Does Scrunch Do?  
Scrunch is a technology company that provides an AI-focused search optimization platform for brands. In the era of AI-driven search (where people ask chatbots and AI assistants for information), Scrunch helps businesses ensure their content appears in those AI-generated answers ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/#:~:text=Unlock%20the%20new%20way%20to,reach%20customers)). In practice, this means Scrunch monitors how a company’s brand shows up in responses from large language models (LLMs) and AI search tools, and it helps improve that visibility. The platform can even generate an **AI-friendly version** of a website to make its content more easily understood and cited by AI systems ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/#:~:text=Unlock%20the%20new%20way%20to,reach%20customers)). In short, Scrunch’s mission is to make brand content “instantly understandable and accessible to AI,” effectively acting as a form of SEO for AI-based search results.  

## How Scrunch Helps Businesses  
Scrunch’s platform is designed to help businesses **be discovered and chosen** in AI-driven customer journeys. It continuously **monitors a brand’s presence** across major AI platforms (like chatbot search interfaces), tracking where and how often the brand is mentioned in AI responses ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Monitoring%20tracks%20how%20your%20brand,compare%20your%20performance%20to%20competitors)). This gives marketing teams insight into their current visibility and how they stack up against competitors. The service then provides **actionable insights** – for example, it automatically spots errors or gaps in a site’s content that might prevent AI from reading it correctly, and identifies opportunities to optimize content for better AI search visibility ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Insights%20analyzes%20why%20your%20brand,to%20improve%20AI%20search%20visibility)). By following Scrunch’s recommendations (e.g. adding certain content, fixing site structure, or using proper metadata), businesses can improve their chances of being cited or recommended by AI assistants. This translates into real outcomes: companies using Scrunch have reported significant increases in traffic and customer engagement from AI search – one client even saw **4× growth** after making AI search a core part of their strategy with Scrunch’s help ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScrunch%20helped%20us%20turn%20AI,%E2%80%9D)). In essence, Scrunch helps businesses turn the rise of AI search into a competitive advantage by ensuring they **“show up” in AI-driven results** and reach customers who rely on AI tools.  

## AI Search Optimization Platform  
Scrunch offers a comprehensive **AI search optimization platform** made up of three core products ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=The%20Scrunch%20platform%20has%20three,AXP)):  

- **Monitoring** – Tracks how your brand appears in AI platform responses in real time. This includes measuring your brand’s presence and position in AI-generated answers, sentiment of mentions, and citation frequency across all major AI assistants and search models ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Monitoring%20tracks%20how%20your%20brand,compare%20your%20performance%20to%20competitors)). The monitoring tool lets users filter results by topic, persona, region, or specific AI model, and even compare their performance to competitors to see where they stand.  
- **Insights** – Analyzes the reasons behind your brand’s performance in AI search and provides recommendations. Scrunch’s insights engine automatically detects issues (like pages that an AI can’t crawl or understand), identifies optimization opportunities, and gives content recommendations to improve the brand’s visibility in AI results ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Insights%20analyzes%20why%20your%20brand,to%20improve%20AI%20search%20visibility)). This helps businesses understand *why* they are or aren’t appearing in AI answers and what they can do to rank higher.  
- **Agent Experience Platform (AXP)** – Handles the technical side of making web content AI-friendly. AXP automatically recognizes when AI agents (crawlers or chatbots) visit your website and serves them a parallel version of the site that’s optimized for LLMs ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=AXP%20automatically%20detects%20AI%20agent,platforms%20reference%20and%20cite%20pages)). In other words, it reformats and “translates” your site’s content into AI-friendly formats (without you having to rebuild your whole site) to ensure AI platforms can easily read, reference, and cite your pages. This improves how often and how accurately AI platforms include your content in their answers.  

Together, these three components allow businesses to **monitor**, **understand**, and **improve** their performance in AI-driven search. The platform gives a full loop: first showing how a brand currently appears in AI results, then explaining why, and finally enabling fixes (both strategic and technical) to boost that presence ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Monitoring%20tracks%20how%20your%20brand,compare%20your%20performance%20to%20competitors)) ([scrunch.com](https://scrunch.com/faqs/what-products-does-scrunch-offer-for-ai-search-optimization#:~:text=Insights%20analyzes%20why%20your%20brand,to%20improve%20AI%20search%20visibility)). This all-in-one approach is what makes Scrunch’s offering a dedicated *AI search optimization* solution.
