# Pain Segment: AI search started sending us customers — and we can’t control it (new channel emergence)

## What this pain is
AI assistants and AI search surfaces become a real acquisition and influence channel. The company sees early evidence (traffic/leads/conversions) but lacks a repeatable operating cadence—what to measure weekly, which prompts matter, and which actions actually move results.

## Who feels it (common owners)
- Growth / Demand Gen
- SEO / Content
- Analytics / RevOps (attribution + reporting)
- PMM (narrative + claims alignment)

## Trigger moments (what creates urgency)
- First visible AI-driven leads/signups (or leadership believes it’s imminent)
- A competitor publicly claims “AI search growth” and leadership wants a response
- Manual prompt testing starts, but it’s inconsistent, doesn’t scale, and produces conflicting conclusions

## Signals (more accurate / higher-fidelity)

### High-confidence (direct evidence)
- Web analytics shows consistent referrers from AI products (or measurable “dark” uplift paired with self-reported AI discovery).
- Inbound leads explicitly state: “Found you via ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude” (forms, sales calls, emails).
- A repeatable set of prompts shows your brand appearing/cited and correlates with downstream conversions.

### Strong (repeatable patterns)
- More prospects arrive with unusually well-formed evaluation questions (AI pre-research), and they quote AI summaries.
- Attribution team adds (or is asked to add) an “AI referrals” line item / dashboard, but nobody owns it.
- Multiple teams independently start “AI checks” (PMM, SEO, Sales) because it’s impacting their work.

### Weak (needs validation)
- Leadership enthusiasm without evidence (“AI is the future”) and no owner or metrics.
- One-time spikes with no lead quality or conversion signal.

### Anti-signals (deprioritize)
- They refuse any measurement changes (UTMs, form fields, attribution), but want channel management outcomes.
- They want only “monitoring” with no execution loop (content + site changes).

## Where to detect it (data sources)
- Web analytics: referrers, landing page entry patterns, assisted conversions
- CRM: “How did you hear about us?” fields; lead notes; call transcripts
- Product analytics: self-reported source at signup, in-app surveys
- RevOps: dashboard requests for AI attribution, channel definitions

## Qualification questions (fast)
- “Do you have any leads where the buyer explicitly said ‘found you via AI’?”
- “What are the 10 prompts/topics you’d review weekly if you owned this channel?”
- “Who owns the weekly cadence (and can ship content/site changes)?”

## What success looks like (early)
- A weekly operating cadence: priority prompts/topics, owners, and actions
- Clear instrumentation for attribution + a feedback loop from changes → citations/mentions → conversions
