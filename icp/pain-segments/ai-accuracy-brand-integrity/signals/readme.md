# Programmatic Signals (At-Scale) — AI Accuracy + Brand Integrity

These are signals you can **detect programmatically** to find accounts likely to feel:
“AI is saying the wrong thing about us” (pricing/compliance/capabilities/policies).

Use them for:
- Prioritizing outbound lists
- Enriching accounts with “why now” context
- Routing accounts to the right owner (Comms/PMM/SEO/Web)

## Scoring (suggested)
- **3 (High-confidence pain):** direct artifacts (internal data) or public evidence of wrong AI answers
- **2 (Strong indicator):** repeatable patterns that predict wrong/unstable AI answers
- **1 (Awareness indicator):** signals they care about AI ingestion/brand accuracy (but pain not proven)

## Website presence (crawlable signals)

## SEO / SERP signals (third-party “truth” risk)
- [Third parties dominate brand-fact queries](serp-third-party-dominates-brand-facts.md) (2–3)
