# Pain Segment: Competitors are winning the AI answer (share-of-answer loss)

## What this pain is
For category and comparison prompts (“best X”, “X vs Y”, “alternatives to X”), AI assistants recommend competitors—sometimes even when classic SEO or brand awareness is strong. This segment is about **losing the AI-recommended default**, which shows up as fewer assists, lower win rates, and increased pricing pressure.

## Who feels it (common owners)
- Head of SEO / Content
- Growth / Demand Gen
- Product Marketing (PMM)
- Sales leadership (often the internal “this hurts” champion)

## Trigger moments (what creates urgency)
- Buyers forward AI summaries during evaluation (“AI says Competitor A is better for…”)
- Leadership asks for “AI share-of-voice/share-of-answer” and nobody can answer
- A competitor starts dominating high-intent category prompts across multiple models

## Signals (more accurate / higher-fidelity)

### High-confidence (direct evidence)
- A deal thread includes a buyer-provided AI transcript comparing vendors.
- Sales enablement creates/adopts “what AI says about us vs competitors” collateral.
- A repeatable prompt set shows competitor-first citations across multiple models (not a one-off).

### Strong (repeatable patterns)
- You rank for informational SEO, but **AI answers cite competitor docs** for the same topics.
- “Alternatives to {your brand}” prompts trend toward competitor recommendations.
- Competitor pages appear consistently as citations for “best {category} for {persona/use-case}”.

### Weak (needs validation)
- They “feel” competitors are everywhere in AI, but can’t name prompts or competitors.
- They only monitor one model or one vague category prompt.

### Anti-signals (deprioritize)
- They want a single “rank #1 in ChatGPT” outcome with no scope for content/site iteration.
- They can’t agree on a priority category, persona, or competitor set.

## Where to detect it (data sources)
- CRM: competitor fields, `Closed Lost` reasons, battlecard requests
- Sales: enablement docs, Slack threads, call transcripts for “AI recommended”
- Content/SEO: existing comparison pages, “alternatives” pages, and missing/citation-gap topics
- Market: competitor blog/docs velocity; new landing pages targeting your core prompts

## Qualification questions (fast)
- “Name the 5 prompts you most want to win. Who shows up today (by model)?”
- “Which competitor(s) show up for your highest-intent buyer questions?”
- “If we moved citations on 10 prompts this month, which KPI should change (pipeline, win rate, CAC)?”

## What success looks like (early)
- A “citation gap list” by topic/persona/model (what competitors get cited for that you don’t)
- A prioritized publish/fix plan (pages + structure + claims) with early movement on high-intent prompts
